# A4--OLAP-cube-PLSQL-supermarket-dataset

## Introduction:
   Given the supermarket dataset, we intent to develop a OLAP cube from the raw supermarket data and transform the data as tables using PLSQL for further data integration and visualization

## Objective: 
  * To integrate data's such that OLAP cube is formed
  * To master PLSQL language and the concept of OLAP cube
  * Visualize the OLAP cube using QLIKSENSE

## PLSQL code
